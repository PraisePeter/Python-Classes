Romeo and Juliet is a tragic story of two teens from feuding families (Montagues and Capulets) in Verona who fall instantly in love at a party, secretly marry, but are tragically driven to suicide by their families' hatred, their deaths ultimately ending the feud. A messenger fails to tell Romeo about Juliet faking her death, so he drinks poison in her tomb; she wakes, finds him dead, and stabs herself.
